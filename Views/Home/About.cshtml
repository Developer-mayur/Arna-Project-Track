        This Admin Dashboard is a web-based application built using <strong>ASP.NET Core MVC</strong> and <strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> for managing users, employees, and project information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this system is to allow administrators to:
        <ul>
            <li>Create, view, update, and delete user records</li>
            <li>Assign roles such as Admin, Manager, and Employee</li>
            <li>Manage employee departments and joining dates</li>
            <li>Associate users with roles and departments for structured access</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The application is built with a responsive layout using <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> and includes features such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Custom sidebar navigation</li>
            <li>Role-based dashboard UI</li>
            <li>Secure logout functionality</li>
            <li>Dynamic data rendering with Razor Views</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        It follows the <strong>MVC architectural pattern</strong> to separate concerns and make the code easy to maintain and scale.
    </p>
